# Deprecated: functions-backend

This project deploys Cloud Functions from `functions/` (Gen2 TypeScript).

`functions-backend/` is deprecated and kept only to preserve history.

## Do not deploy from here

Do not run `firebase deploy` with a config that points at `functions-backend/`.

## Deploy now

From repo root:

- `firebase deploy --only functions`
