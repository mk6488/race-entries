## Roadmap (lightweight)

### Now
- Export/print polish: clearer guidance for PDFs and per-page layouts
- Diagnostics usability: refine validator sampling presets
- Small UI polish and accessibility follow-ups

### Next
- Offline resilience: graceful handling when network drops (read-only messaging)
- Role-based permissions review (beyond admin diagnostics) if needed
- Data integrity checks: indices/constraints reviews, validator rule refinements

### Later
- Export enhancements: multi-page print presets per view, PDF save guidance
- Broader observability: lightweight metrics/log shipping (if allowed)
- UI quality backlog: consistent microcopy, additional keyboard shortcuts
