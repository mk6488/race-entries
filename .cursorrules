# Cursor Project Rules

- Always commit and push after successful code edits so Netlify can deploy:
  - Run: git add -A && git commit -m "<type(scope): concise summary>" && git push
  - Use the existing branch (main) unless instructed otherwise.
  - After pushing, inform the user: "Pushed. Netlify should deploy shortly."

- Before declaring work done:
  - Run linter checks on edited files and fix clear issues.
  - Preserve existing indentation style and width in all edits.

- Tooling hygiene:
  - Prefer absolute paths in tool calls.
  - Provide a brief status update when running tools.

- Domain-specific:
  - After edits to `src/pages/Race.tsx` or `src/pages/Entries.tsx`, quickly verify print styles remain clean.
